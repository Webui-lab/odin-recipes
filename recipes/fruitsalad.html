      <h1>Fruit Salad Recipes</h1>
      <p>
        Fruit salad is one of those wonderful gifts of nature that you can enjoy
        as often as you like without worrying about side effects. This is how to
        make Nigerian fruit salad. The plate below is that of a complete fruit
        mix, just how I serve it periodically in Nigeria.

      <p>
        This is a popular recipe from Nigeria. If you look closely, it wouldn’t
        be hard to find your favorites fruits at the fruit market in your area.
        I think watermelon comes top on my list of favorite Nigerian fruits;
        followed by pineapples, oranges, pawpaw, mangoes, apples – in that exact
        order.

        <h2><strong>Preparation</strong></h2>

        <li>
          Peel off the back of the pawpaw, pineapples, oranges, and grapes, this
          part should be easy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then chop the pineapples/paw paw/watermelon to mouth-size bits with a
          kitchen knife and a clean tray.
        </li>
        <li>Squeeze out the grape/orange juice and set aside in a cup</li>
