      <h1>Spaghetti Recipes</h1>
      <p>
        Here is a delicious spaghetti Jollof, one of the most popular foods in
        Nigeria. Spaghetti is food to more than a million Nigerians. We could
        make this Jollof out of it or just boil it and serve with stew/tomato
        sauce and meatballs. It is actually chicken… since we don’t eat lots of
        meatballs in Nigeria.

        I have tried several other recipes and this proves to be the best so far
        and I am sure you are going to love it. Partly because of the use of
        carrots and green beans, ingredients that I consider to be highly
        nutritional.

        <li>1 cups of sliced onions</li>
        <li>Fresh tomatoes and Pepper</li>
        <li>Ground Crayfish</li>
        <li>3 seasoning cubes</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup of sliced carrot</li>

        <h2><strong>How To Prepare Spaghetti</strong></h2>

        <li>
          Cut/chop the carrot, green beans, and green pepper to desirable sizes.
          Below is the image of parboiled spaghetti in a bowl, carrot and green
          beans in a plate, sliced tomato, onions, and pepper. I used a
          combination of fish and cow-kidney while making this spaghetti meal.

        </li>
        <li>
          Parboil the meat and fish with all the necessary ingredients I like to
          use just 2 seasoning cubes, a teaspoon of salt and a half cup of
          sliced onions. Parboiling the meat alone is a good practice, you get
          the chance to extract the stock from the meat which is an integral
          part of Nigerian cooking. I like to parboil the meat/fish while making
          any Nigerian food with a cup of water and all the necessary
          ingredients. This practice will enable you to end up with very tasty
          meat and also provide the meat stock (meat water) that is used in
          making most Nigerian foods. You can learn more about this practice
          later. Using an electric blender, grind the crayfish and also blend
          the tomatoes/pepper together.
