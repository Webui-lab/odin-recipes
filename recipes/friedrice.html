        This recipe shows you how to make fried rice the Nigerian way. I make
        this once every month and my family always looks forward to it. Most
        often I serve with fried chicken, you can grill your chicken instead. I
        am sure I detailed this recipe enough and would make the entire process
        a cakewalk. Here is the complete ingredient for making this delicious
        Nigerian food.

        <h2><strong>Preparation</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Most Nigerian foods start with you parboiling the meat to be used,
          Most Nigeria foods including fried rice goes along with fried or
          cooked meat. The most popular meat in Nigeria is chicken. So let’s
          make fried rice and chicken the Nigerian way.
        </p>
        <li>
          Parboil chicken and liver (both together) with all the spices (a
          teaspoon of salt, half cup of sliced onions, a teaspoon of thyme
          spice, a teaspoon of curry, two seasoning cubes teaspoon each of
          powdered ginger and garlic).
        </li>
        <li>
          Chop the cabbage, green beans, carrot, liver and set aside in a wide
          tray as you can find in the video below or the image above. This
          process is easy, I normally use just a knife and chopping board or a
          tray. The sample image below shows you some ingredients in small
          quantities. Chopped cow liver(1), chicken stock (meat water)(2), green
          peas(3) Chopped cabbage(4) chopped carrot(5), green beans(6), and
          sweet corn (7). Remove the white center seeds from the green pepper
          and also slice and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Parboil the 2 cups of rice also and cook with half of the meat stock
          (water from the meat) and two cups of water, cook until it is about
          70% done. Observe the rice closely. It doesn’t need to be too soft or
          too hard, just almost done.
        </li>
